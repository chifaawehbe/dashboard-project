## Dashboard Project (Covid)

For our open-source project, we will create an interactive **Covid-19** dashboard that allows users to visualize the number of Covid-19 cases or deaths per country as a function of time.

Go to the terminal where you cloned the project:
to install streamlit: pip install streamlit
to install matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
