## Dashboard Project (Covid)

For our open-source project, we will create an interactive **Covid-19** dashboard that allows users to visualize the number of Covid-19 cases or deaths per country as a function of time.

#### Create the virtual environment
1. Open VS code
1. Go to the terminal where you cloned the project
1. To create the new environment, run the command: `python3 -m venv dashboard-env` 
1. Activate your virtual python environment : `source dashboard-env/bin/activate` 
1. Install the dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
